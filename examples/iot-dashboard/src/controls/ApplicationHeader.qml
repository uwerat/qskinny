 * It's a behavior similar to the typical mobile web browser addressbar
 * the minimum, preferred and maximum heights of the item can be controlled with
 * * minimumHeight: default is 0, i.e. hidden
 * * preferredHeight: default is Units.gridUnit * 1.6
 * * maximumHeight: default is Units.gridUnit * 3
 *
 * To achieve a titlebar that stays completely fixed just set the 3 sizes as the same
