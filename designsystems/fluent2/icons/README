SVGs have been taken from https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons/tree/main/assets.

Icons are available in different sizes. As SVGs can be scaled we only need
one version of them - chosing the '12'.

As we are replacing the colors of the SVGs using graphic filters we set the
color in the SVGs manually to black ( instead of #212121 ). So they are in
line with icons coming from somewhere else.

Names have been shortened ( ic_fluent_xyz_16_regular.svg -> xyz.svg )
