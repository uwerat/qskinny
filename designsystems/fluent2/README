The Figma model uses the "Segoe Fluent Icons" [1]. Unfortunately its license is 
too restrictive for being included in the QSkinny project.  Fortunately similar
icons are also available from the "Fluent UI System Icons" project [2].

However glyph names/numbers and the corresponding unicode values do not match
and can't be taken 1:1 from the Figma model.

"Fluent UI System Icons" offers different icon packages ( as font ):

    - FluentSystemIcons-Light.ttf
    - FluentSystemIcons-Regular.ttf
    - FluentSystemIcons-Filled.ttf
    - FluentSystemIcons-Resizable.ttf

For some reason ( might be a bug in the downloaded version ) the checkmark
glyph offered from the "Regular" font ( pixelsize 12 ) is different
( works better ) to the one from the "Resizable" font.

That's why we decided to use the "Regular" font for now.
