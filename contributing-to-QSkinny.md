# Contributing to QSkinny

We want to have the possibility to transfer the QSkinny code to a **more
permissive license** in the future, i.e. any of the following: BSD "Simplified"
License, BSD "Revised" License, MIT license.

If you are fine with this, you are welcome to contribute to QSkinny by
completing the following steps:

1. Agree to the terms of the Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA).
  You can create a pull request first, then the licensing bot will check
  automatically whether you already signed the FLA or not. If you have not
  signed the agreement yet, it will leave a comment on the pull request on how
  to proceed.
  The agreement for contributions is similar to the one that other projects use
  (e.g. KDE e.V.). For more information, see
  https://fsfe.org/activities/fla/fiduciary.en.html
1. Submit your pull request for review.
