/*!
    \enum QskQuickItem::UpdateFlag

    Qt/Quick classes have a tendency to update items too early
    and too often. To avoid processing of unwanted operations
    QskQuickItem implements a couple of modifications, that
    can be en/disabled individually.

    \sa updateFlags(), resetUpdateFlags()
        testUpdateFlag(), setUpdateFlag(), resetUpdateFlag()

    \var QskQuickItem::UpdateFlag QskQuickItem::DeferredUpdate

        Creating of scene graph nodes is blocked when being invisible.

        The default implementation of Qt/Quick creates scene graph nodes for all items
        in the scene what might become a significant factor for the startup performance
        ( and memory footprint ) of large user interfaces.

        Instead of trying to work around these problems by asynchrounous instantiation
        strategies ( QQmlIncubator ) the DeferredUpdate flag offers a much simpler
        and obvious solution: don't instantiate before really needed.

    \saqt QQuickItem::isVisible()

    \note Some more advanced algorithms have not yet been implemented,
          such as viewport frustrum culling (i.e. hiding items outside of the
          window geometry).

    \var QskQuickItem::UpdateFlag QskQuickItem::DeferredPolish

        Polishing an item is blocked when being invisible.
        F.e for all items being derived from QskControl the layout calculations
        happen during polishing.

    \saqt QQuickItem::updatePolish(), QQuickItem::polish()

    \var QskQuickItem::UpdateFlag QskQuickItem::DeferredLayout

        Recalculations of the implicitSize are blocked until being explicitly requested. 

        When being enabled the item indicates layout relevant changes by
        sending a QEvent::LayoutRequest ( similar to QWidget ) to its parent item
        without recalculating the actual size hints ( f.e the implicitSize ).

        When having layout code that relies on binding the implicit width/height
        the QskQuickItem::DeferredLayout flag needs to be disabled.

    \note All layout classes offered by the Qt/Quick modules of the Qt Company
          ( f.e anchors ) do require immediate updates of the implicit size. 

    \sa QskQuickItem::resetImplicitSize()
    \saqt QQuickItem::implicitSize()

    \var QskQuickItem::UpdateFlag QskQuickItem::CleanupOnVisibility

        Delete scene graph nodes, when the item becomes hidden.
        Enabling this mode will reduce the memory footprint, but comes at the cost
        of having to recreate nodes once the item gets shown again.

    \saqt QQuickItem::isVisible()

    \var QskQuickItem::UpdateFlag QskQuickItem::PreferRasterForTextures

        When creating textures from QskGraphic, prefer the raster paint
        engine over the OpenGL paint engine.

    \var QskQuickItem::UpdateFlag QskQuickItem::DebugForceBackground

        Always fill the background of the item with a random color.

    \note This flag is useful when analyzing layouts.

*/

/*!
    \property QskQuickItem::geometry

    This property holds the geometry of the item relative to its parent item.
    When changing the geometry, the item receives a QskEvent::GeometryChange event.

    \sa geometryChangeEvent(), geometryChange(), rect
*/

/*!
    \property QskQuickItem::rect

    This property returns the internal geometry of the item.
    It equals QRect(0, 0, width(), height() ).

    \sa geometryChangeEvent(), geometryChange(), geometry
*/

/*!
    \var QskQuickItem::transparentForPositioners

    When transparentForPositioners is set the item indicates, that it should be excluded
    from any layout calculations. This flag is actually a concept of QQuickItem, that
    has not been exposed to its public API.

    \sa isTransparentForPositioner()
*/

/*!
    \property QskQuickItem::tabFence

    The tabFence flag can be used to create local tab focus chains. It is usually
    used in combination with QQuickItem::ItemIsFocusScope.

    QskPopup is an example where the focus tab chain is expected to continue
    with the first child instead of leaving the popup, when reaching its end.

    \sa isTabFence(), QQuickItem::ItemIsFocusScope
    \saqt QQuickItem::ItemIsFocusScope
*/

/*!
    \property QskQuickItem::visibleToParent

    Flag indicating if an item would become visible if its parentItem() is shown.
    The implementation relies on the internal explicitVisible flag, that has not
    been exposed by the public API of QQuickItem.

    In many situations it is important to know if an item has been explicitly hidden
    because of a setVisible( false ) or it is a child of an item, that is in
    an invisible state. F,e for calculating the size hint for a hidden container
    it is necessary to know which children would stay hidden when the container
    becomes visible.

    \sa isVisibleToParent()
    \saqt QQuickItem::setVisible()
*/

/*!
    \property QskQuickItem::polishOnResize

    When polishOnResize is set QQuickItem::polish() will be called automatically
    whenever the size of the item has been changed. This is usually necessary
    when the item is a container and the layout of its children depends on the
    size of the container.

    \sa QskControl::updateLayout(), QskControl::autoLayoutChildren
*/

/*!
    \property QskQuickItem::initiallyPainted

    Status flag indicating that there has already been a call
    of QQuickItem::updatePaintNode() since the item has become visible.

    Before each initial call of updatePaintNode() the specific
    hook aboutToShow() is called, that is intended to be overloaded.

    \sa isInitiallyPainted(), aboutToShow()
*/

    A property indicating if the item has child items.

    \saqt QQuickItem::childItems(), QQuickItem::parentItem()
*/

/*!
    \property QskQuickItem::updateFlags

    QskQuickItem offers several tweaks to the Qt/Quick update cycle,
    that can be en/disabled individually.

    The flags are a combination from bits that have been explicitly set
    by setUpdateFlag() and those being derived from the aapplication
    wide default settings, that can be set with QskSetup.
