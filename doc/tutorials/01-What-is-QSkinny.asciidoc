QSkinny is a UI framework based on the Qt graphic stack and written in
{cpp}. It allows users to write their UIs in {cpp} and/or QML.

picture above. For the Fendt Tractor GUI there is no QML used at all;
the whole codebase is written in {cpp}. An overview of how QSkinny fits
into the Qt architecture is depicted below:
